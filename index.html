      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>A computer Information Systems Graduate who is seeking employment with the opportunity to excel and learn.
         Throughout my degree, I learnt how to utilise my creativity and intuition to reach solutions for complex problems.
         I say my greatest strength is the ability to organise and to be able to work around issues that have arisen in a calm and forward-thinking manner.
        When I had work experience in an oil company called Seadrill, I was involved in setting up the network for their new Liverpool office.
        This entailed racking all the cisco hardware in line with the supplied rack diagram.
        I was also responsible for patching in all the desktops and printers as well as a patching schedule for the local and offshore support teams.
